# How to Create Memorable Runway Act 2 Characters

You can now fully animate any character—face, body, and even voice—from just a single selfie video. With Runway Act 2's upgrade, lifelike character animation is finally as easy as dragging and dropping a video, opening creative possibilities that were unthinkable just months ago.

Most people are still stuck with static avatars or jittery motion capture. Meanwhile, the new AI workflow lets you bring your brand's characters to life with convincing gestures, expressions, and even lip sync—all in minutes, not days.

Here's the exact process that's redefining animated content creation (and saving serious time and money):

- **Start at runwayml.com:** Sign in and head to "Generate Video." Look for "Perform with Act 2" (or switch to it in Gen 4 Turbo).
- **Upload a driving video:** Just record yourself moving and speaking. The AI uses your performance to drive any character's animation.
- **Pick your character:** Use Runway's examples or upload your own. Aspect ratio controls give you full creative framing: crop, zoom, and reposition as you like.
- **Generate in seconds:** If you pay with credits, videos render in ~20 seconds. Unlimited/free mode is slower (about 2 minutes), but you can run unlimited jobs.  
- **Fine-tune expressions and gestures:** Not expressive enough? Crank facial animation up to 5. Don't want random hand movements? Disable gesture control. (Heads up: some hand enlarging still happens—Runway's not perfect yet).
- **Batch production:** On credits, generate unlimited videos at once. Free mode lets you run only two at a time.

But high-quality animation needs more than good motion—it needs great character art. Here's how to make your AI avatars pop:

- **Craft your character in MidJourney:** Use detailed prompts (ChatGPT can help!) to get the look you want. Important: position the character's eyes where you want them in-frame for best results.
- **Expand, zoom, and edit your art:** MidJourney's "edit" and aspect ratio tools let you reframe, zoom out, or expand your scene much better than Photoshop's generative features.
- **Upscale for perfection:** Always use MidJourney's gallery upscaler or an external one like Magnific. A simple skin detail prompt in Magnific can transform fuzz into photorealistic close-ups.  
- **Get creative with style transfer:** Want your selfie to become Spider-Man? Use Mystic or Relight/Style Transfer in Freepik/Magnific, referencing both your image and a chosen style mascot. The results keep your original structure and pose but completely swap the look.

"As I discovered after four hours on slow mode: credits make video generation about 6x faster," the creator admits. "And after using MidJourney and Magnific together, the detail level destroys anything you'd get from stock images or Photoshop alone."

This new workflow means you can:

- Animate a custom avatar from scratch in under 10 minutes.
- Seamlessly match brand visuals by iterating character style and framing.
- Outsource less, experiment way more, and keep your content visually fresh.
